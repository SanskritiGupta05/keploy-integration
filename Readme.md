# Keploy Integration:

Made my first application using GO language and Echo & integrated Keploy in it.
It is a simple API with Echo Golang framework.

run the API, by the command
```go
go run server.go
```
test the API by request to `http://localhost:3000/hello`  the response will be:
```json
{"message":"Hello World"}
```
